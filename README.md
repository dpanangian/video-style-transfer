# Overview

This package started as a complete refactor of the code provided by [rkhamilton](https://github.com/rkhamilton/) & [NerdyRodent](https://github.com/nerdyrodent/), which started out as a Katherine Crowson VQGAN+CLIP-derived Google colab notebook.

In addition to refactoring NerdyRodent's code into a more pythonic package to improve usability, this project includes the following noteable elements:
* LPIPS loss
* Fewshot-patch-based training to apply changes on videos
